    - The code should work, but it might throw an exception in:
                                        game.ManagerOfCharacters.login and game.ManagerOfCharacters.login
    due to the relative path... In IntelliJ, it's not an issue, but eclipse might have troubles handling that.
    So, when starting application in Eclipse:
        right-click the main.class->Run as->Run Configurations...->Arguments->Working Directory

        there set up the directory, which contains also database folder, where are located files:
        passwords.txt and userNames.txt

        Without this step, the application might be in infinite loop during log-in/register process. And well,
    you are able to log-in directly with:
                        Username: test
                        Password: test
    Or, you are able to create a new account during registration and set your own credentials.

    Design patterns:

    - Observer:
        src\game\ObserverDP
        - observes the budget state (checks the value)
        - when the value is changed (method which affects budget is being executed) the notifyListeners is triggered
        - value of the budget is then changed in GUI

    - MVC design pattern:
        src\MVC_pattern
        - AppController represents the Controller, handles the communication, events and data flow from view to model and vice versa
        - ViewGUI represents the View, handles the interaction with user, based on the interaction is also logic/data executed/affected
        - src\game\ManagerOfCharacters represents the Model, handles data, logic and whole verification process

    - Strategy design pattern:
        src\game\StrategyDP
        
    
    	Details and more can be found in documentation. Hope that the code is acceptable and also that the final
    points will be satisfying.
